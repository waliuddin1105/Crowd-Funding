The minimum donation is PKR 100. There is no maximum limit - you can donate as much as you'd like to support a cause.

### Can I get a tax deduction for my donation?
Tax deductibility depends on the campaign type and your local tax laws. Contact support for a tax receipt if the campaign qualifies as a charitable contribution in your jurisdiction.

## Donation Security

### Is my payment information secure?
Absolutely. We use:
- Industry-standard SSL/TLS encryption
- PCI-DSS Level 1 certified payment processing

- **Expired card**: Use a valid card
- **Network timeout**: Try again after a few minutes

If problems persist, contact our support team.

### Can someone else see my donation?
By default, your name appears on the campaign page as a supporter (amount visible). You can choose to donate anonymously to keep your identity private, though the campaign creator will still see your name for receipt purposes.

### What happens to my donation if the campaign doesn't reach its goal?
Your donation goes to the campaign creator regardless of whether the goal is met. Our platform uses a "flexible funding" model where creators receive all funds raised. If you're concerned, check if the campaign has a refund policy specified.

## Refunds & Disputes

### Can I get a refund?

- Campaign cancellation before fund disbursement
- Unauthorized transactions

### How do I request a refund?
Contact support within 30 days with:

Our team will review and respond within 5-7 business days.

### How long do refunds take?
Once approved, refunds are processed within:

- PayPal: 3-5 business days
- EasyPaisa/JazzCash: 3-5 business days

Timing may vary based on your bank or payment provider.

### What if I was charged twice by accident?
Contact support immediately with both transaction IDs. We'll verify the duplicate charge and process a refund for the extra charge within 3-5 business days.

### Can I dispute a charge with my bank?
While you can initiate a chargeback through your bank, we encourage contacting us first. Bank chargebacks can take longer and may affect your account standing. We're committed to resolving issues quickly and fairly.

## Anonymous Donations

### How do I donate anonymously?
Check the "Donate Anonymously" box during checkout. Your name won't appear on the campaign page or in the donor list.

### Will the campaign creator know who I am?
Campaign creators receive your name and email for receipt purposes, even for anonymous donations. However, your information won't be displayed publicly.

### Can I send a message anonymously?
Public comments display your username. For completely anonymous communication, create a separate account or contact support to relay a message.

### Does anonymous donation affect my receipt?
No, you'll still receive a complete receipt with all transaction details. The anonymity only affects public visibility on the campaign page.

### Are there additional fees for international donations?
