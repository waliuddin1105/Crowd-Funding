# Campaign Creator FAQs

## Getting Started

### Who can create a campaign?
Anyone 18 years or older with:
- Valid identification (CNIC or Passport)
- A legitimate cause requiring funding
- Proper documentation to support their case
- A bank account for receiving funds

### Is it free to create a campaign?
Yes, creating and submitting a campaign is completely free. We only charge a 5% platform fee on donations received. If your campaign doesn't receive any donations, you don't pay anything.

### How long does campaign approval take?
- **Standard campaigns**: 3-7 business days
- **Urgent medical emergencies**: Expedited review (24-48 hours)
- **High-value campaigns** (>PKR 1M): 5-10 business days (additional verification)

The timeline depends on documentation completeness and verification complexity.

### What information do I need to start a campaign?
Required information:
- Valid ID (CNIC or Passport)
- Contact details (verified phone and email)
- Bank account information (IBAN)
- Campaign details (title, category, story, target amount)
- Supporting documentation (category-specific)
- Photos or videos related to your cause

### Can I create multiple campaigns?
Yes, but each campaign must be for a different cause and meet our verification standards. You cannot create duplicate campaigns for the same purpose.

## Campaign Setup

### How do I write a compelling campaign story?
Follow these tips:
- **Be Honest**: Tell your real story authentically
- **Be Specific**: Explain exactly why you need funds
- **Be Clear**: Breakdown how funds will be used
- **Be Personal**: Share your journey and challenges
- **Include Details**: Names, dates, locations, amounts
- **Show Evidence**: Reference your uploaded documents
- **Express Gratitude**: Thank potential supporters

### What should my funding goal be?
Set a realistic goal that covers:
- Your actual need (medical bills, tuition, etc.)
- Platform fees (5%)
- Payment processing fees (1.5% - 3.4%)
- A small buffer for unexpected costs (optional)

Example: If you need PKR 100,000, set your goal to PKR 110,000-115,000 to account for fees.

### How long should my campaign run?
- **Standard duration**: 30-60 days
- **Medical emergencies**: 30-45 days
- **Long-term projects**: 60-90 days
- **Extensions**: Request if you need more time

Urgent campaigns create urgency; longer campaigns allow time to build momentum.

### What photos or videos should I upload?
Upload clear, relevant images:
- **Medical**: Hospital records, treatment areas, patient photos (with consent)
- **Education**: Admission letters, school/university, student photos
- **Emergency**: Damage photos, incident site, affected areas
- **Personal**: Your photo, location, situation
- **Documents**: Scan of relevant paperwork (ensure readability)

Videos add authenticity - film a 1-2 minute explanation of your situation.

## Documentation Requirements

### What documents do I need for medical campaigns?

### Can I add documents after submission?

### How do I verify my identity?
Upload:
1. Clear photo of your CNIC (front and back) or Passport
2. Selfie holding your ID next to your face
3. Ensure photos are well-lit and all details are readable

### Do I need to verify my bank account?

This ensures funds can be transferred securely.
