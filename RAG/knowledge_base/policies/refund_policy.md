# Refund Policy

**Last Updated**: January 2025

## Overview

This Refund Policy outlines the circumstances under which donations made through our crowdfunding platform may be refunded. Due to the nature of crowdfunding as voluntary charitable contributions, refunds are generally not provided except under specific conditions outlined below.

## General Refund Principles

### Understanding Donations vs. Purchases
- **Donations are contributions**, not purchases or investments
- No guarantee of specific outcomes or returns
- Generally considered non-refundable once processed
- Campaign creators are responsible for fund usage
- Platform facilitates transfers but doesn't guarantee results

### Platform's Role
We act as an intermediary:
- Facilitating donation processing
- Verifying campaign legitimacy
- Transferring funds to campaign creators
- We don't control how funds are ultimately used
- Campaign creators are responsible to donors for fund usage

## When Refunds ARE Available

- Report to support for investigation
- We'll attempt to contact creator
- Refund only if fraud or policy violation confirmed

### 5. Personal Financial Hardship

- Economic difficulties affecting your budget
- Unexpected expenses arising
- Donations are non-refundable gifts

### 6. Campaign Outcome Unsatisfactory
